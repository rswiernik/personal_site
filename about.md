Hey everyone,
I'm a systems administrator and software developer based out of San Francisco.
I enjoy messing with software, hardware, and general tinkering with things to
make them my own.

I recently graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a degree in
Applied Networking and Systems Administration. The majority of my experience is
in Python, C, Perl, and a wide variety of Linux and Windows systems adminstration
and automation. I currently work for [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) on the
Physical Infrastructue Tooling team working on our system installer.

If you want to look at any of my code, [my Github](http://github.com/rswiernik)
has some of my work!


This Jekyll theme was crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com)
