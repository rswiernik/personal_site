Hey everyone,
I'm a systems administrator and software developer based out of Rochester, NY. I enjoy messing with hardware, software, and simply tinkering with things to make it my own.

I'm a student at Rochester Institute of Technology and am currently in my second year studying Applied Networking and Systems Administration. I really enjoy learning an as part of this I hope to start documenting things that I learn along the way here on this site. I have had experience with (in no certain order) Python, C, Perl, and a large base of Windows, Mac, and Linux troubleshooting.

If you want to look at any of my code, ([my Github](http://github.com/rswiernik)) has some of my work and will be constantly updated as I become more motivated to get my code online.
