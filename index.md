I'm Reed, a Site Reliability and Software Engineer based out of San Francisco.
When not working, you'll find me [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/18431814),
cosplaying as a photographer, or messing with my keyboards.

I currently work at <a class="plum" href="https://plum.wine">Plum</a> where I wear
many different hats. Over my time here I've worked on:

* Backend API and service development in Python
* AWS Infrastructure Automation w/ Terraform, Ansible, and Packer
* Monitoring solutions using Cloudwatch and Elasticsearch
* CI/CD and Developer Tooling built on top of Jenkins


Previously I was at [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) where I spent my tenure working on:

* Server Fleet Management
* Full Disk Encryption
* Time Series Data Monitoring
* Caching Solutions (Mainly Memcache)
