I'm Reed, a Infrastructure Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer based out of San Francisco.
When not working you'll find me [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/18431814),
cosplaying as a photographer, or messing with my keyboards.

Currently I'm a Senior Software Engineer II at <a class="dutchie" href="https://dutchie.com">Dutchie</a>
working on the Platform Infrastructure team. Over my time at Dutchie I've worked to deliver developer
tools that make deploying services to Kubernetes and working with cloud infrastructure a breeze.

I was previously a part of the software team at <a class="plum" href="https://plum.wine">Plum</a> wearing
many different hats. Over my time here I've worked on:

* Backend API and service development in Python
* AWS Infrastructure Automation w/ Terraform, Ansible, and Packer
* Monitoring solutions using Cloudwatch and Elasticsearch
* CI/CD and Developer Tooling built on top of Jenkins


Previously I was a Site Reliability Engineer at <a class="dropbox" href="https://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
where I spent my tenure working on:

* Server Fleet Management
* Full Disk Encryption
* Time Series Data Monitoring
* Caching Solutions (Mainly Memcache)
