I'm Reed, a Site Reliability Engineer and Bike/Keyboard fanatic based out
of San Francisco.

Occasionally I put things on [my Github](http://github.com/rswiernik), feel free to poke around!

I most recently worked at [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) working on a variety of projects
including:
* Server Fleet Management
* Full Disk Encryption
* Time Series Data Monitoring
* Caching Solutions (Mainly Memcache)
