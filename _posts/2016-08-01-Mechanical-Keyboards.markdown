There's this odd sense of joy in finding the keyboard that is just right for you.
It has the weight that is just right for how you type. It has the right number
of keys. It is the right size, taking up just enough space on your desk. This
fascination, this obsession to find the keyboard that is just right for me is
what got me in to keyboards and what keeps driving my interest to this day.

Alright, before you think I'm just romancing a piece of everyday office equipment.

It's odd, really, to think that so many people put so little thought into one of
the most heavily used devices that they own. Think about it.
