Hey everyone,

I just figured I'd make a first post here to introduce myself and kick off my new blog.

First an formost I'm a student at Rochester Institute of Technology and am currently in my second year studying Applied Networking and Systems Administration. I really enjoy learning an as part of this I hope to start documenting things that I learn along the way here on this site. I have had experience with (in no certain order) Python, C++, Perl, and a large base of Windows, Mac, and Linux troubleshooting.

If you want to look at any of my code, [my Github][personal-gh] has some of my work and will be constantly updated as I become more motivated to get my code online.
